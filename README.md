# Break-the-String

We have a string and the aim is to construct a paragraph by breaking the given string into substrings where each substring 
represents a line of paragraph. 
We are also provided with a parameter maxlength which gives the maximum number of characters in a line.

Write a function to achieve the same. Function should return substrings in a list.
